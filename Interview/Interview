* What is ‘good’ screen-based design?
* Good screen-based design would be easy to read as well as aesthetically pleasing. In my opinion, a use of legible fonts and minimal amount of color would work well for the eye.


* How is art-making online different than art-making offline?
* I think both digital and traditional art should be appreciated as they have qualities that differ from each other, but are considered art. 


* What do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web?
* The purpose of the web is to supply knowledge to the public whether it be through photos, videos, or text. It is also a milestone for mankind as we have developed such technology that has changed our society as a whole.


* How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?
* It is has honestly improved over the years and has helped bring people together, but also tear them apart. Yes, we have handfuls of information that helps us to research and get inspiration or even watch a funny video about cats, but there is also the dark side of the web where people sell things that are illegal to the public. 


* How does the web impact graphic design?
* Besides many graphic designers having their own website, the way they portray their work online is also very important. It can appeal to a future or former client and get you more recognition for a possible job.
